Creational Patterns
Abstract Factory
Abstract Factory
Lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Main article
Code example
Builder
Builder
Lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

Main article
Code example
Factory Method
Factory Method
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Main article
Code example
Prototype
Prototype
Lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

Main article
Code example
Singleton
Singleton
Lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

Code example
Structural Patterns
Adapter
Adapter
Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

Main article
Code example
Bridge
Bridge
Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

Main article
Code example
Composite
Composite
Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

Main article
Code example
Decorator
Decorator
Lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

Main article
Code example
Facade
Facade
Provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

Main article
Code example
Flyweight
Flyweight
Lets you fit more objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in each object.

Main article
Code example
Proxy
Proxy
Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

Code example
Behavioral Patterns
Chain of Responsibility
Chain of Responsibility
Lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

Main article
Code example
Command
Command
Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

Main article
Code example
Iterator
Iterator
Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

Main article
Code example
Mediator
Mediator
Lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a mediator object.

Main article
Code example
Memento
Memento
Lets you save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

Main article
Code example
Observer
Observer
Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.

Main article
Code example
State
State
Lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. It appears as if the object changed its class.

Main article
Code example
Strategy
Strategy
Lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Main article
Code example
Template Method
Template Method
Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.

Main article
Code example
Visitor
Visitor
Lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
